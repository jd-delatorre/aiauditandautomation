## What is an AI Automation Audit?

### Your Business Has Hidden Automation Opportunities

Every business has tasks that eat hours every week — answering the same questions, scheduling appointments, chasing invoices, writing reports. The problem isn't that AI can't help. It's that most businesses don't know where to start.

**An AI Automation Audit changes that.** We analyze your workflows, communication channels, and daily operations to identify 5-15 specific automation opportunities — each with ROI estimates so you know exactly what you're leaving on the table.

### What the Audit Covers

- **Communication workflows** — How you handle customer inquiries, internal messaging, and follow-ups
- **Scheduling & calendars** — How appointments get booked, reminders sent, and no-shows handled
- **Email & documents** — Time spent on email triage, document requests, reporting
- **Repetitive tasks** — Manual processes that happen daily/weekly that could be automated
- **Response times** — How quickly leads and customers get responses, and what falls through the cracks
- **Data entry** — Where information is manually transferred between systems

### What You Get

A written **AI Automation Audit Report** with:
- 5-15 identified automation opportunities
- Estimated hours saved per week for each
- ROI estimates and cost savings
- Implementation difficulty ratings (Easy / Medium / Complex)
- Prioritized roadmap — what to do first, second, third
- Technology recommendations

### Why Every Business Needs One

You don't know what you don't know. Most business owners underestimate how much time their team spends on automatable work. The audit puts a number on it — and a plan to fix it.

## What is OpenClaw?

### How We Implement Your Audit Findings

Once we identify your automation opportunities, **OpenClaw** is how we build them. It's an open-source, self-hosted AI assistant that runs on your own infrastructure — not in someone else's cloud.

Think of the audit as the diagnosis. OpenClaw is the treatment.

**Unlike ChatGPT or other cloud AI tools:**
- It runs on YOUR servers (or a VPS you control)
- Your data never leaves your systems
- No per-message fees — just the underlying AI costs
- Connects directly to WhatsApp, Slack, email, calendars, and more
- Can automate real tasks, not just answer questions

### What OpenClaw Is Best For

✅ **Always-on availability** — Responds to customers at 2 AM without you lifting a finger

✅ **Multi-channel communication** — One AI that handles WhatsApp, Slack, Telegram, email, and more from a single brain

✅ **Repetitive task automation** — Drafting emails, generating quotes, scheduling appointments, sending reminders

✅ **Data privacy** — Perfect for businesses handling sensitive information (legal, medical, financial)

✅ **Custom workflows** — Can be trained on YOUR processes, YOUR templates, YOUR way of doing things

✅ **Integration flexibility** — Connects to Google Workspace, browser automation, file systems, databases

✅ **Cost control** — No surprise bills based on "conversations" or "seats"

### What OpenClaw Is NOT

❌ **Not a magic button** — It requires setup, training, and occasional tuning. It's powerful, but not plug-and-play. That's why the audit comes first — we know exactly what to build.

❌ **Not a replacement for human judgment** — It's an assistant, not a decision-maker. Critical decisions still need human oversight.

❌ **Not free to run** — While OpenClaw itself is free, you'll pay for AI API usage (Claude/OpenAI) and hosting. Typical costs: $20-100/month depending on usage.

❌ **Not a chatbot widget** — It's not the "chat bubble" you put on a website. It's a back-office automation tool that can respond via messaging apps.

❌ **Not for high-volume consumer support** — If you need to handle 10,000 customer chats/day, you need enterprise solutions. OpenClaw excels at 10-500 interactions/day.

❌ **Not maintenance-free** — Like any software, it needs updates and occasional attention. That's what our retainer plans are for.

## How It Works: The Process

### Step 1: Book Your AI Audit
Schedule a time. We meet in person or via Zoom to understand your business, your pain points, and your workflows.

### Step 2: We Analyze Your Business
We observe your team's daily operations (2-3 hours on-site or via Zoom), interview key team members, and map out every repetitive workflow.

### Step 3: You Receive Your Audit Report
Within 1-2 weeks, you get a written report with 5-15 automation opportunities, ROI estimates, and a prioritized roadmap.

### Step 4: Implementation
Choose which opportunities to tackle first. We build the automations using OpenClaw — install, configure, connect to your tools, and customize for your workflows.

### Step 5: Training & Ongoing Support
Your team learns the system. We provide documentation specific to your setup. Optional monthly retainers keep everything running and expanding.

### What You Handle (Ongoing Costs)

| Item | What It Is | Typical Cost |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **AI API Subscription** | Claude (Anthropic) or OpenAI account | $20-100/month based on usage |
| **Hosting** | VPS server (DigitalOcean, Hetzner, etc.) | $5-20/month |
| **Messaging APIs** | WhatsApp Business API, if applicable | Varies (often free for low volume) |

**Why it works this way:** You maintain direct relationships with these providers. No middleman markup. Full transparency on costs. If we part ways, you keep everything — it's YOUR infrastructure.

### Timeline

## FAQ

We review your entire business operation to identify where AI can automate repetitive work, improve response times, and save money. You get a written report with specific opportunities, ROI estimates, and a prioritized roadmap.

**How much does the audit cost?**
$500, which is applied as a credit toward any implementation package. If you proceed with implementation, the audit is effectively free.

### General Questions

**What exactly am I paying for?**
Two things: (1) The AI Automation Audit ($500) — our expertise and time to analyze your business and deliver a written report with actionable recommendations. (2) Implementation — the skilled labor to install, configure, and customize OpenClaw for your business based on the audit findings.

**Is this the same as ChatGPT?**
No. ChatGPT is a chat interface owned by OpenAI. OpenClaw is a self-hosted automation platform that can USE ChatGPT (or Claude) as its "brain," but it does much more — it connects to your tools, automates workflows, and runs 24/7 on your infrastructure.

**Why self-hosted instead of a SaaS product?**
Three reasons: (1) Your data stays private, (2) No per-message fees that scale unpredictably, (3) You own the system — no vendor lock-in.

**Can this work for my specific industry?**
The audit works for any industry. We have experience with marketing agencies, contractors, real estate, accounting, and e-commerce. If your work involves repetitive communication, document handling, or scheduling, there are automation opportunities to find.

### Costs & Pricing

**What are the ongoing costs after implementation?**
Typically $25-120/month total:
- AI API (Claude or OpenAI): $20-100/month depending on how much you use it
- Hosting (VPS): $5-20/month
- That's it. No hidden fees.

**Why do I need to pay for Claude/OpenAI separately?**
OpenClaw is the platform — it needs an AI "brain" to power it. You choose which AI provider you want (we recommend Claude). By keeping this separate, you get direct pricing with no markup, full control, and no dependency on us.

**What if I use it a lot? Will costs explode?**
AI costs scale with usage, but they're predictable. A typical small business doing 50-200 AI interactions/day might spend $40-80/month on API costs. We'll help you estimate during the audit.

**Do you offer payment plans?**
The audit is $500 upfront. Implementation fees are 50% upfront, 50% on completion. Monthly retainers are billed monthly via Stripe.

---

### Technical Questions

**What do I need to provide?**
- A computer that stays on, OR approval to set up a small cloud server ($5-20/month)
- An AI API account (we'll help you set this up — takes 10 minutes)
- Access to the messaging accounts you want to connect (WhatsApp, Slack, etc.)
- 2-4 hours of your time for training

**Do I need technical skills?**
No. We handle all the technical setup. You just need to be able to use WhatsApp, Slack, or whatever messaging apps you already use.

**What if something breaks?**
That's what our retainer plans are for. Essentials ($250/mo) includes monitoring and 2 hours of support. If you're not on a retainer, we offer ad-hoc support at $150/hour.

**Can I add more features later?**
Absolutely. Start with the top audit recommendations, then add more channels or workflows as you see ROI. Our retainer plans include time for enhancements. We also offer quarterly audit check-ins to identify new opportunities.

**Is my data safe?**
Yes. OpenClaw runs on infrastructure YOU control. Your conversations, files, and business data never pass through our servers. You can even use local AI models for complete privacy (advanced setup).

### Working With Us

**Are you local to New Jersey?**
Yes! We're based in NJ and work primarily with NJ businesses. We can meet in person for the audit observation and training, or work remotely — your choice.

**How long does the full process take?**
Audit: 1-2 weeks. Implementation: 1-2 weeks after audit approval. Total from first call to go-live: 3-5 weeks.

**What if the audit doesn't find anything useful?**
In our experience, every business has automation opportunities. But if we genuinely don't find meaningful opportunities, we'll be upfront about it. The $500 still applies as credit toward future services.

**What happens if I want to stop using your services?**
You keep everything. The installation, the configurations, the automations — it's all on YOUR infrastructure. We don't hold anything hostage. We'll even do a clean handoff if you want to manage it yourself or hire someone else.

**Do you offer a guarantee?**
We guarantee the audit will deliver a comprehensive, actionable report. For implementation, we guarantee the installation will work as specified in our proposal. If we can't deliver what we promised, we'll refund the completion payment (second 50%).
