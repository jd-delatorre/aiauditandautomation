# NJ AI Automation — Marketing Campaign Guide

## Brand Voice

### Tone Descriptors

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Professional but conversational** | We sound like a trusted advisor over coffee, not a corporate brochure |
| **Data-driven** | Every claim is backed by numbers — hours saved, dollars earned, ROI estimates |
| **No-BS** | Direct, honest, transparent. We say what AI can AND can't do |
| **Advisor-first** | We lead with understanding the business, not pushing a product |
| **Local and personal** | NJ-based, in-person relationships, we know your market |

### Voice Do's and Don'ts

**Do:**
- Lead with the problem before presenting the solution
- Use specific numbers ("20+ hours/week" not "save time")
- Address objections head-on ("AI isn't magic — but it IS powerful")
- Speak to business owners and ops managers directly
- Reference NJ and local business culture
- Use "we" and "your" — make it conversational
- Show empathy for the daily grind of running a business

**Don't:**
- Use generic AI hype ("revolutionary", "game-changing", "cutting-edge")
- Make vague promises without numbers
- Sound like a tech company talking to tech people
- Be pushy or salesy — educate first, sell second
- Use jargon (say "self-hosted" not "on-premise containerized deployment")
- Oversell — be honest about what AI can and can't do
- Ignore the human element — automation helps people, not replaces them

### Example Phrases

**Problem framing:**
- "Your team is drowning in repetitive tasks"
- "How many hours this week went to copy-paste and follow-up emails?"
- "You don't know what you don't know — that's what the audit is for"
- "Every missed inquiry is money left on the table"

**Solution framing:**
- "We find exactly where AI can save you 20+ hours a week"
- "5-15 specific automation opportunities — each with ROI estimates"
- "The audit puts a number on what you're leaving on the table"
- "Your data stays on your servers. No per-message fees. Ever."

**CTA framing:**
- "Book a free 30-minute discovery call"
- "In two weeks, you'll know exactly where AI can save you time and money"
- "The $500 audit is credited toward implementation — if you proceed, it's free"

## Content Pillars

Seven recurring themes that rotate through all social content:

### 1. Problem Awareness
Surface the pain points business owners feel daily.
- Repetitive tasks eating hours
- Missed inquiries and slow response times
- Manual data entry and copy-paste workflows
- Email overload and scheduling chaos

### 2. Industry Spotlights
Deep dives into specific industries with real numbers.
- **Marketing agencies:** 30 hrs/week wasted, $4,500/week value at $150/hr
- **Electricians/contractors:** 25 hrs/week wasted, $625/week value, missed after-hours inquiries
- **Construction:** RFP bottlenecks (15 hrs/project), subcontractor scheduling chaos
- **Accounting firms:** 10 hrs/week on document requests, 10 hrs on email overload
- **Real estate:** 15 hrs/week on slow lead response, showing coordination headaches
- **E-commerce:** 20+ hrs/week on repetitive customer support

### 3. How It Works
Educate on the audit process and what the client actually gets.
- 4-step process: Discovery call, Audit, Report, Implement
- 1-2 week turnaround
- Written report with 5-15 opportunities
- ROI estimates and prioritized roadmap

### 4. Data Privacy & Self-Hosted
Our biggest technical differentiator.
- Your data stays on YOUR servers
- No per-message fees (unlike SaaS chatbots)
- Full audit trail of all AI actions
- Option for on-premise AI models (complete privacy)
- No third-party data sharing

### 5. Local NJ Focus
Build trust through proximity and shared identity.
- NJ-based, serving NJ businesses
- In-person meetings available
- Understanding of local business landscape
- NJ-specific industry references (Essex, Bergen, Morris counties)

### 6. Transparency & Honesty
Build trust by saying what AI ISN'T.
- AI isn't magic — it's a tool that needs proper setup
- Not every business needs it (we'll tell you honestly)
- The audit reveals real data, not sales fluff
- We're an advisor first, installer second

### 7. Social Proof & Results
Share statistics, audit findings, and results.
- 5-15 opportunities found per audit
- 20+ hours saved per week (typical)
- 40-50% of audits convert to implementation
- Industry-specific ROI numbers
- Audit deliverable quality (professional report)
