### Domain & Hosting
- [x] Check domain availability — all three domains confirmed available (Feb 23, 2026)
- [ ] Register domains (Cloudflare Registrar recommended — at-cost pricing, no markup, no renewal hikes)

  **Domains to Register:**

  | Domain | Purpose | Registrar | Annual Cost | Notes |
  |--------|---------|-----------|-------------|-------|
  | **njaiautomation.com** | Primary — business name, email, branding | Cloudflare | ~$10.44/yr | At-cost, no markup |
  | **njaiautomation.ai** | Brand reinforcer — signals AI expertise | Cloudflare | ~$70/yr | 2-year minimum required ($140 upfront) |
  | **njaiaudit.com** | Campaign domain — audit offering, ads, networking | Cloudflare | ~$10.44/yr | At-cost, no markup |

  **Estimated Total Year 1: ~$161** ($140 for .ai 2-year min + ~$21 for two .com domains)
  **Estimated Annual Renewal: ~$91/yr** ($70 .ai + ~$21 for two .com domains)

  **Registrar Price Comparison (.ai — 2-year minimum):**

  | Registrar | 2-Year Cost | Renewal (2yr) | WHOIS Privacy | Notes |
  |-----------|-------------|---------------|---------------|-------|
  | Spaceship | $137.96 | $137.96 | Free | Cheapest, owned by Namecheap |
  | **Cloudflare** | **$140.00** | **$140.00** | **Free** | **At-cost, best long-term value** |
  | Porkbun | $144.80 | $144.80 | Free | Good support, quirky brand |
  | Namecheap | $159.96 | $179.96 | Free | Price increase Mar 5, 2026 ($92.98/yr reg, $114.98/yr renewal) |
  | GoDaddy | $194.98 | $289.98 | Free | Most expensive, avoid |

  **Why Cloudflare:** At-cost pricing (no markup ever), same price on registration and renewal, free WHOIS privacy, free DNS/CDN/SSL, no upsells. Best long-term value.

  **ACTION:** Register before March 5, 2026 — Namecheap/.ai registry price increase takes effect that date. Cloudflare pricing may also adjust.
